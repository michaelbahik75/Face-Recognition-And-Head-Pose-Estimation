i.User Verification: Students register on a portal for the first time submit personal details, id card and their photo which is saved in the database  and their photo will be used to verify them before the exam.
ii.Multiple face detection: If more than one person is seen in the frame then it will also be logged in the database as malpractice.
iii.Head pose detection: In MCQ-based exams where there is no need for pen and paper, the head position of students will be analysed and if it appears that a student is looking away from the screen its log will also be saved.
